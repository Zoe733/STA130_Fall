In the original anecdote, Fisher was able to use a simple yet effective experiment to determine whether Bristol could genuinely discern the difference in tea preparation methods, not just by chance. Inspired by this historical experiment, a similar test was conducted with 80 students from STA130 to see if they could identify whether milk or tea was poured first.\n",
